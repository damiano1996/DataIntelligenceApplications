Part 2:
\textit{Design a combinatorial bandit algorithm to optimize the budget allocation over the three subcampaigns to maximize the total number of clicks when, for simplicity, there is only one phase. Plot the cumulative regret.}
\label{assPart2}\\

Part 2:
\textit{Design a sliding-window combinatorial bandit algorithm for the case, instead, in which there are the three phases aforementioned. Plot the cumulative regret and compare it with the cumulative regret that a non-sliding-window algorithm would obtain.}
\label{assPart3}\\

Part 4:
\textit{Design a learning algorithm for pricing when the users that will buy the product are those that have clicked on the ads. Assume that the allocation of the budget over the three sub campaigns is fixed and there is only one phase (make this assumption also in the next steps). Plot the cumulative regret.}\label{assPart4}
