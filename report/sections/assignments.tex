Part 2:
\textit{Design a combinatorial bandit algorithm to optimize the budget allocation over the three subcampaigns to maximize the total number of clicks when, for simplicity, there is only one phase. Plot the cumulative regret.}
\label{assPart2}\\

Part 3:
\textit{Design a sliding-window combinatorial bandit algorithm for the case, instead, in which there are the three phases aforementioned. Plot the cumulative regret and compare it with the cumulative regret that a non-sliding-window algorithm would obtain.}
\label{assPart3}\\

Part 4:
\textit{Design a learning algorithm for pricing when the users that will buy the product are those that have clicked on the ads. Assume that the allocation of the budget over the three sub campaigns is fixed and there is only one phase (make this assumption also in the next steps). Plot the cumulative regret.}\label{assPart4}
Part 4:
\textit{Design and run a context generation algorithm for the pricing when the budget allocated to each single subcampaign is fixed. At the end of every week, use the collected data to generate contexts and then use these contexts for the following week. Plot the cumulative regret as time increases. In the next steps, do not use the generated contexts, but use all the data together.}
