\chapter{Pricing: Context Generation}

Design and run a context generation algorithm for the pricing when the budget allocated to each single subcampaign is fixed. At the end of every week, use the collected data to generate contexts and then use these contexts for the following week. Plot the cumulative regret as time increases. In the next steps, do not use the generated contexts, but use all the data together.
