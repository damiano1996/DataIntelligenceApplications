\chapter{Advertising and Pricing: Fixed Prices}

Do the same of Step 6 under the constraint that the seller charges a unique price to all the classes of users. Suggestion: for every possible price, fix this price and repeat the algorithm used in Step 6. Plot the cumulative regret when the algorithm learns both the conversion rate curves and the performance of the advertising subcampaigns.
