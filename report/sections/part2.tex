\chapter{Advertising: Clicks Maximization}

%Design a combinatorial bandit algorithm to optimize the budget allocation over the three subcampaigns to maximize the total number of clicks when, for simplicity, there is only one phase. Plot the cumulative regret.

\section{Algorithm Design Choices and Results}

This section deals with the description of the algorithm design choices we adopted and
it also contains the most relevant reference to the code.
For the description we will adopt the following structure: for each sub-section we will describe the actual scenario
we are interested in by defining its goals and then we focus on how we have solved the problem and 
the results we have obtained.
