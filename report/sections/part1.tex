\chapter{Introduction: Scenario Setup}
We have studied a possible real world scenario in which a seller wants to increase the number of possible buyers by exploiting advertising tools.

The product we have considered is a particular pair of shoes which has a production cost (without loss of generality we can assume that the production cost is null) and a sell price.

The analyzed campaign consists of three sub-campaigns, each with a different ad to advertise the product and each targeting a different class of users. Each class is defined by the values of pre-defined features.

The feature space we have considered is characterized by two binary features: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Age<30} or \textit{Age>30}
\item \textit{Profession} that can be either \textit{student} or \textit{worker}
\end{itemize}

So according to the values of the above described features, we can distinguish among the following classes of users:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Elegant}: a worker with age>30
\item \textit{Casual}: a student with age<30
\item \textit{Sport}: a worker with age<30
\end{itemize}

In each section we have executed 25 experiments and taken the average of all results to evaluate the performances of our algorithms.
Further analyses of these evaluations will be explained in the relative sections.
