\section{Algorithm design choices and Results}
This section deals with the description of the algorithm design choices we adopted and it also contains the most relevant reference to the code.
For the description we will adopt the following structure: for each sub-section we will describe the actual scenario we are interested in by defining its goals and then we focus on how we have solved the problem and the results we have obtained.
