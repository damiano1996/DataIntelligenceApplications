The goal of the project is to model a scenario in which a seller exploits advertising tools in order to attract more and more users to its website, thus increasing the number of possible buyers.
\\
The seller has to learn simultaneously the conversion rate and the number of users the advertising tools can attract.
\\
In this report, we walk through the description of the specific scenario we have studied and the definition of the algorithm design choices we adopted in order to reach our goal.
Then the achieved experimental results will be presented via some useful plots and 
a final conclusion summarizing the whole work.
