Suggestion: the value per click to use in the knapsack-like problem depends on the pricing, that depends on the number of users of a specific class interested in buying the product. Notice that the two problems, namely, pricing and advertising, can be decomposed since each subcampaign targets a single class of users, thus allowing the computation of the value per click of a campaign only on the basis of the number of clicks generated by that subcampaign. Plot the cumulative regret when the algorithm learns both the conversion rate curves and the performance of the advertising subcampaigns."
